### Play it [here](https://madavidcoder.github.io/CodeClicker)!
Code Clicker is a fun web-based clicker game where you 'write' lines of code. The goal is to write as many lines as you possible can!

The gameplay is simple; click to write 'lines'. These lines can be spent on upgrades, which range from increasing the lines per click, to autocders, which write lines passively without the user having to click, allowing for idle progress.

You can also get achievements, as you play. These achievements show up on a cool CRT-style screen, and signify progress within the game.
